#Comparing Machine Learning Models for Urban Relocation Preferences in the UK

Abstract:
This project delves into the intricate process of selecting an ideal residence in the United Kingdom, employing machine learning algorithms to model and analyze various parameters. The goal is to provide a data-driven perspective for choosing favorable living places. The study explores personalized city recommendations based on scraped data from credible online sources. Three machine learning models—Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and ElasticNet—are implemented and compared for predictive accuracy. The results indicate that the Random Forest model outperforms the others, showcasing its effectiveness in generating precise predictions.

Introduction:
Choosing the perfect place to live is a significant decision, especially in a country like the UK with over 70 major cities. This study aims to address the challenges associated with urban relocation by developing a City Recommendation System (CRS) based on user input. Leveraging scraped data from reliable sources, the study evaluates the performance of three machine learning models in predicting and recommending ideal cities for relocation within the United Kingdom.

Motivation of the Study:
Traditional approaches to choosing living places often rely on online reviews, anecdotal advice, and personal preferences. This study seeks to introduce a systematic and data-driven methodology to evaluate and compare different locations, contributing to the overall improvement of residents' quality of life in the UK.

Aims and Objectives:

Review literature on Recommendation Systems, identifying gaps and challenges.
Scrape city data from credible sources and preprocess it.
Identify parameters and data-processing techniques for the proposed model.
Create destination-choice models using Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and ElasticNet.
Develop a recommendation system that allows user input and provides relevant city recommendations.
Literature Review:
The literature review explores existing recommendation systems in various domains, emphasizing their impact on decision-making. It critically analyzes studies on recommender systems in real estate, tourism, and urban sustainability. The review identifies gaps in current research, highlighting the need for scalable personalization, privacy-preserving approaches, and standardized evaluation metrics.

Methodology:
The comprehensive methodology involves data scraping, preprocessing, and constructing the recommendation model. Python, along with libraries such as BeautifulSoup and requests, is used for web scraping. The dataset is acquired from credible sources, and preprocessing steps include outlier identification, normalization, and visualization. The recommender model framework incorporates Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and ElasticNet algorithms, with cross-validation techniques applied for robustness.

Results and Discussion:
The dataset results provide insights into the dynamics of the data, guiding the model-building process. The comparison of three models—Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and ElasticNet—reveals that the Random Forest model demonstrates superior predictive accuracy. The recommender system, incorporating Cosine Similarity, yields personalized city recommendations, with the algorithm trained on the Random Forest model performing exceptionally well.

Conclusion:
The project contributes to the field of recommender systems by focusing on user satisfaction and ethical considerations. It identifies gaps in existing research and proposes innovative solutions. The City Recommendation System developed in this study empowers users with personalized and reliable suggestions, enhancing their decision-making process for urban relocation in the United Kingdom.
